Greetings, i'm Edson.

I'm a developer who likes Flutter, games, anime and Hoshimachi Suisei. 

As i'm only a humble human and i need food to live, i also do full time frontend development with some popular frameworks, such as Next and Vue. 

This is my personal github used for college assignments and small projects, which i usually either archive or delete after some time. If you're looking for production level code, you won't find it in this profile. If somehow you landed here for business reasons, feel free to reach out at gonzalezedson.junior@gmail.com.
